# ybml - @yberreby's ML Library

Utilities for my own usage; may be broken at any time.

Targeting **PyTorch** (`ytch`), **JAX** (`yjax`), and **MLX** (`ymlx`).
Core, framework-independent code is in `ymc`.

## Testing
- `uv run just`: linting, type checking, formatting, testing, coverage.

## End-to-end demo(s)

- `uv run just demo ytch_two_moons`: utterly toy task; uses MLFlow.
- `uv run just demo single_img_deep_coord_mlp`: NeRF-style coordinate MLP mapping `(x,y)` to `(r,g,b)` to learn an image with a few twists.

See `./justfile` for up-to-date commands.
